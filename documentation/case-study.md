## Implementation Guide

### Task 1: Unlimited Data Storage and Retrieval
#### S3 Bucket Configuration

**Bucket Setup:**
- **Name:** `xyz-corp-storage-[unique-suffix]`
- **Region:** us-east-1 (or preferred region)
- **Versioning:** Enabled
- **Encryption:** SSE-S3 (default)
- **Public Access:** Configured via bucket policy

#### Public Access Configuration

**Bucket Policy for Public Read Access:**
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::xyz-corp-storage-[unique-suffix]/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Task 2: Lifecycle Management (Auto-delete after 75 days)

#### Lifecycle Rule Configuration

**Rule Name:** `Auto-Delete-After-75-Days`

**Policy Timeline:**
- **Day 30:** Transition to Standard-IA (cost optimization)
- **Day 60:** Transition to Glacier Flexible Retrieval
- **Day 75:** Permanent deletion
- **Multipart uploads:** Auto-cleanup after 7 days

**Cost Impact:** Up to 60% storage cost reduction through intelligent tiering.

### Task 3: Version Control and Recovery

#### Versioning Implementation

**Status:** Enabled during bucket creation

**Key Features:**
- Multiple versions of same object automatically maintained
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Protection against accidental deletion/modification
- Version-specific access via unique version IDs

**Recovery Process:** Select object → Show versions → Download/restore desired version

### Task 4: Static Website Hosting

#### Website Configuration

**Website Bucket Setup:**
- **Bucket name:** Domain-based naming (e.g., `www.xyzcorp.com`)
- **Static hosting:** Enabled with index.html and error.html
- **Public access:** Configured for website content

**DNS Configuration (Route 53):**
- **Hosted Zone:** Created for custom domain
- **A Record:** Points to S3 website endpoint
- **CNAME Record:** Handles www subdomain routing

**Files Required:**
- `index.html` - Main website page
- `error.html` - Custom error page (404 handling)

### Task 5: Custom Error Page

#### Error Handling Implementation

**Custom 404 Page Features:**
- Professional branded error page
- Clear error messaging and navigation
- Automatic routing for invalid URLs
- Consistent with website design

**Configuration:** Error document set to `error.html` in static website hosting settings
