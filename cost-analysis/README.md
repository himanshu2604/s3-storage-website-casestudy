## Cost Breakdown by Business Size

### Small Business (10K monthly visitors)
- **Monthly Cost:** $8-12
- **Primary Costs:** Data transfer (60%), S3 storage (20%), Route 53 (15%)
- **Storage:** ~1 GB website content
- **Data Transfer:** ~50 GB/month

### Medium Business (100K monthly visitors)
- **Monthly Cost:** $75-120
- **Primary Costs:** CloudFront/data transfer (70%), S3 storage (15%), monitoring (10%)
- **Storage:** ~5 GB active + 10 GB archived content
- **Data Transfer:** ~500 GB/month

### Enterprise (1M+ monthly visitors)
- **Monthly Cost:** $800-1,500+
- **Primary Costs:** Global data transfer (75%), storage (10%), advanced monitoring (10%)
- **Storage:** ~50 GB active + 500 GB archived
- **Data Transfer:** ~5 TB/month

## Key Cost Drivers

1. **Data Transfer Out (60-75% of total cost)**
   - Most significant variable cost
   - Reduced by CloudFront caching

2. **S3 Storage (15-25% of total cost)**
   - Standard vs IA vs Glacier pricing
   - Lifecycle policies for optimization

3. **DNS & Monitoring (10-20% of total cost)**
   - Route 53 hosted zones and queries
   - CloudWatch metrics and alarms

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Immediate Actions (0-30 days)
1. **Enable S3 Intelligent Tiering** - Automatic cost optimization
2. **Configure CloudFront** - Reduce data transfer costs by 40-60%
3. **Implement Lifecycle Rules** - Move old content to cheaper storage classes
4. **Compress Assets** - Reduce storage and transfer costs

### ROI Impact
- CloudFront implementation: 40-60% reduction in data transfer costs
- Intelligent Tiering: 10-30% storage cost reduction
- Asset optimization: 15-25% overall cost reduction

## Cost Monitoring

### Budget Alerts
- Set alerts at 50%, 80%, 100% of monthly budget
- Monitor unusual traffic spikes
- Track storage growth trends

### Key Metrics
- Cost per visitor: Total monthly cost รท unique visitors
- Storage efficiency: Content size vs. storage costs
- Transfer efficiency: Data transfer costs vs. traffic volume

## Monthly Budget Planning

- **Small Business:** $15/month (with 25% buffer)
- **Medium Business:** $150/month (with 25% buffer)
- **Enterprise:** $2,000/month (with 30% buffer)

*Buffers account for traffic spikes and growth*
